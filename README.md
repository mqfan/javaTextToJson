# javaTextToJson
This project uses the json-simple jar found at https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple. raw_thesaurus.txt consists of a list of words and their synonyms. Each key word is followed by a list of different usages and respective synonyms. This program simply collapses all usages of a particular word into a single JSON object of keyword and a list of synonyms.
